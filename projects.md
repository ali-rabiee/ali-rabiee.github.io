## Kinova RL: a ROS package for Shared Control Deep Reinforcement Learning
This ROS package implements a shared control Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for robotic manipulation
using a Kinova robotic arm. The system integrates visual input from a camera, head motion data from an IMU
sensor, and a trained DQN (Deep Q-Network) agent to control the robotâ€™s actions. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/Kinova_RL)

## Dual-Mode Robotic Arm Control with GUI and IMU Integration
This project integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to provide
dual-mode control of a robotic arm. Users can choose to control the robotic arm by clicking on cursor buttons in the
GUI or by using the IMU sensor to move the cursor for button selection. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/ClickMove-Robotics)

## Panorama Creation via Harris Corner Detection and Image Stitching
This project involves the creation of panoramic images by detecting key interest points in multiple images using the
Harris corner detector. After identifying these points, the project matches them between images and computes the
homography to accurately align and stitch the images together, resulting in panoramic views. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/Keypoint-Extraction-and-Matching)
