## Selected Projects 

### Kinova RL: a ROS package for Shared Control Deep Reinforcement Learning
This ROS package implements a shared control Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system for robotic manipulation
using a Kinova robotic arm. The system integrates visual input from a camera, head motion data from an IMU
sensor, and a trained DQN (Deep Q-Network) agent to control the robotâ€™s actions. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/Kinova_RL)

### Adaptive Robotic Control for Users with Severe Impairments using DRL
A system that optimizes mapping from low-DoF inputs to high-dimensional robotic actions, enabling intuitive control for users with severe impairments. It uses adaptive goal prediction and reinforcement learning to guide actions in real-time, seamlessly blending user input with autonomous assistance. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/amplification_DRL)

### Dual-Mode Robotic Arm Control with GUI and IMU Integration
This project integrates a graphical user interface (GUI) with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor to provide
dual-mode control of a robotic arm. Users can choose to control the robotic arm by clicking on cursor buttons in the
GUI or by using the IMU sensor to move the cursor for button selection. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ali-rabiee/ClickMove-Robotics)
