### About me
I'm a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Rhode Island, working on medical robotics and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. My research focuses on advancing human-computer interaction through innovative machine learning applications. I design and implement algorithms for real-time biosignal classification and interpretation. By developing multimodal AI frameworks that integrate biosignals and computer vision techniques, I create more intuitive interfaces. These frameworks are used to train reinforcement learning agents for shared autonomy systems, allowing for seamless collaboration between humans and AI. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey is rich with practical experience as a machine learning engineer, a role I held while pursuing my Master's.
